Proteins play important roles in living organisms, and their function is directly linked with their structure. Due to the growing gap between the number of proteins being discovered and their functional characterization in particular as a result of experimental limitations, reliable prediction of protein function through computational means has become crucial.

In this we are doing fours steps: 

1.Import Required Libraries and Processing the data
2.Loading the data
3.Testing 
4.Training the data and finally we will get our model.

I have attached source code for further reference and detailed Pdf file.
